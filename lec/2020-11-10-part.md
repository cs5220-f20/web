### Reminder: Sparsity and partitioning

![](figs/part-mat2graph.svg){width=60%}

Want to partition sparse graphs so that

-   Subgraphs are same size (load balance)
-   Cut size is minimal (minimize communication)

Uses: parallel sparse matvec, nested dissection solves, \...

### A common theme

Common idea: partition under static connectivity

-   Physical network design (telephone, VLSI)
-   Sparse matvec
-   Preconditioners for PDE solvers
-   Sparse Gaussian elimination
-   Data clustering
-   Image segmentation

Goal: Big chunks, small "surface area" between

### Graph partitioning

![](figs/part_ref.svg){width=30%}

Given: $G = (V,E)$, possibly weights + coordinates.\
We want to partition $G$ into $k$ pieces such that

-   Node weights are balanced across partitions.
-   Weight of cut edges is minimized.

Important special case: $k = 2$.

### Vertex separator

### Edge separator

![](figs/part_esep.svg){width=60%}

### Node to edge and back again

![](figs/part_v2esep.svg){width=40%}

Can convert between node and edge separators

-   Node to edge: cut edges from sep to one side
-   Edge to node: remove nodes on one side of cut

Fine if degree bounded (e.g. near-neighbor meshes).\
Optimal vertex/edge separators very different for social networks!

### Cost

How many partitionings are there? If $n$ is even,
$$
  \begin{pmatrix} n \\ n/2 \end{pmatrix} =
    \frac{n!}{( (n/2)! )^2} \approx 
    2^n \sqrt{2/(\pi n)}.
$$
Finding the optimal one is NP-complete.

We need heuristics!

### Partitioning with coordinates

-   Lots of partitioning problems from "nice" meshes
    -   Planar meshes (maybe with regularity condition)
    -   $k$-ply meshes (works for $d > 2$)
    -   Nice enough $\implies$ cut $O(n^{1-1/d})$ edges\
        (Tarjan, Lipton; Miller, Teng, Thurston, Vavasis)
    -   Edges link nearby vertices
-   Get useful information from vertex density
-   Ignore edges (but can use them in later refinement)

### Recursive coordinate bisection

![](figs/part_esep_bisect.svg){width=30%}

Idea: Cut with hyperplane parallel to a coordinate axis.

-   Pro: Fast and simple
-   Con: Not always great quality

### Inertial bisection

Idea: Optimize cutting hyperplane via vertex density
$$\begin{aligned}
    \bar{\mathbf{x}} &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{x}_i, \quad
    \bar{\mathbf{r}_i} = \mathbf{x}_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}} \\
    \mathbf{I}&= \sum_{i=1}^n\left[ \|\mathbf{r}_i\|^2 I - \mathbf{r}_i \mathbf{r}_i^T \right]
\end{aligned}$$
Let $(\lambda_n, \mathbf{n})$ be the minimal eigenpair
for the inertia tensor $\mathbf{I}$, and choose the hyperplane through
$\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ with normal $\mathbf{n}$.

### Inertial bisection

![](figs/part_esep_inertia.svg){width=40%}

-   Pro: Simple, more flexible than coord planes
-   Con: Still restricted to hyperplanes

### Random circles (Gilbert, Miller, Teng)

-   Stereographic projection
-   Find centerpoint (any plane is an even partition)\
    In practice, use an approximation.
-   Conformally map sphere, centerpoint to origin
-   Choose great circle (at random)
-   Undo stereographic projection
-   Convert circle to separator

May choose best of several random great circles.

### Coordinate-free methods

![](figs/part_matrix.svg){width=30%}

-   Don't always have natural coordinates
    -   Example: the web graph
    -   Can add coordinates? (metric embedding)
-   Use edge information for geometry!

### Breadth-first search

![](figs/part_bfs.svg){width=30%}

-   Pick a start vertex $v_0$
    -   Might start from several different vertices
-   Use BFS to label nodes by distance from $v_0$
    -   We've seen this before -- remember RCM?
    -   Or minimize cuts locally (Karypis, Kumar)
-   Partition by distance from $v_0$

### Spectral partitioning

Label vertex $i$ with $x_i = \pm 1$. We want to minimize
$$\mbox{edges cut} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{(i,j) \in E} (x_i-x_j)^2$$
subject to the even partition requirement $$\sum_i x_i = 0.$$ But this
is NP hard, so we need a trick.

### Spectral partitioning

$$\mbox{edges cut} 
    = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{(i,j) \in E} (x_i-x_j)^2 
    = \frac{1}{4} \|Cx\|^2 = \frac{1}{4} x^T L x
$$
where $C=$ incidence matrix, $L = C^T C = $ graph Laplacian:
$$\begin{aligned}
    C_{ij} &= 
      \begin{cases}
         1, & e_j = (i,k) \\
        -1, & e_j = (k,i) \\
         0, & \mbox{otherwise},
      \end{cases} &
    L_{ij} &= 
    \begin{cases} 
      d(i), & i = j \\
      -1, & (i,j) \in E, \\ 
      0, & \mbox{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{aligned}$$ 
Note: $C e = 0$ (so $L e = 0$), $e = (1, 1, 1, \ldots, 1)^T$.

### Spectral partitioning

Now consider the *relaxed* problem with $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$:
$$\mbox{minimize } x^T L x \mbox{ s.t. } x^T e = 0 \mbox{ and } x^T x = 1.$$
Equivalent to finding the second-smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ and
corresponding eigenvector $x$, also called the *Fiedler vector*.
Partition according to sign of $x_i$.

How to approximate $x$? Use a Krylov subspace method (Lanczos)!
Expensive, but gives high-quality partitions.

### Spectral partitioning

### Spectral coordinates

Alternate view: define a coordinate system with the first $d$
non-trivial Laplacian eigenvectors.

-   Spectral partitioning = bisection in spectral coords
-   Can cluster in other ways as well (e.g. $k$-means)

### Spectral coordinates

### Refinement by swapping

![](figs/part_swap0.svg){width=40%}

Gain from swapping $(a,b)$ is $D(a) + D(b) - 2w(a,b)$, where
$D$ is external - internal edge costs: 
$$\begin{aligned}
D(a) &= \sum_{b' \in B} w(a,b') - \sum_{a' \in A, a' \neq a} w(a,a') \\
D(b) &= \sum_{a' \in A} w(b,a') - \sum_{b' \in B, b' \neq b} w(b,b') 
\end{aligned}$$

### Greedy refinement

![](figs/part_swap0.svg){width=40%}

Start with a partition $V = A \cup B$ and refine.

-   $\operatorname{gain}(a,b) = D(a) + D(b) - 2w(a,b)$
-   Purely greedy strategy: until no positive gain
    -   Choose swap with most gain
    -   Update $D$ in neighborhood of swap; update gains
-   Local minima are a problem.

### Kernighan-Lin

In one sweep, while no vertices marked

- Choose $(a,b)$ with greatest gain
- Update $D(v)$ for all unmarked $v$ as if $(a,b)$ were swapped
- Mark $a$ and $b$ (but don't swap)
- Find $j$ such that swaps $1, \ldots, j$ yield maximal gain
- Apply swaps $1, \ldots, j$

### Kernighan-Lin

Usually converges in a few (2-6) sweeps. Each sweep is $O(|V|^3)$. Can
be improved to $O(|E|)$ (Fiduccia, Mattheyses).

Further improvements (Karypis, Kumar): only consider vertices on
boundary, don't complete full sweep.

### Multilevel ideas

Basic idea (same will work in other contexts):

-   Coarsen
-   Solve coarse problem
-   Interpolate (and possibly refine)

May apply recursively.

### Maximal matching

One idea for coarsening: maximal matchings

-   *Matching* of $G = (V,E)$ is $E_m \subset E$ with no common
    vertices.
-   *Maximal*: cannot add edges and remain matching.
-   Constructed by an obvious greedy algorithm.
-   Maximal matchings are non-unique; some may be preferable to others
    (e.g. choose heavy edges first).

### Coarsening via maximal matching

![](figs/part_coarsen.svg){width=60%}

-   Collapse matched nodes into coarse nodes
-   Add all edge weights between coarse nodes

### Software

All these use some flavor(s) of multilevel:

-   METIS/ParMETIS (Kapyris)
-   PARTY (U. Paderborn)
-   Chaco (Sandia)
-   Scotch (INRIA)
-   Jostle (now commercialized)
-   Zoltan (Sandia)

### Graph partitioning: Is this it?

Consider partitioning just for sparse matvec:

-   Edge cuts $\neq$ communication volume
-   Should we minimize *max* communication volume?
-   Communication volume -- what about latencies?

Some go beyond graph partitioning (e.g. hypergraph in Zoltan).

### Graph partitioning: Is this it?

Additional work on:

-   Partitioning power law graphs
-   Covering sets with small overlaps

Also: Classes of graphs with no small cuts (expanders)

### Graph partitioning: Is this it?

Recall: partitioning for matvec *and* preconditioner

-   Block Jacobi (or Schwarz) -- relax on each partition
-   Want to consider edge cuts *and physics*
    -   E.g. consider edges = beams
    -   Cutting a stiff beam worse than a flexible beam?
    -   Doesn't show up from just the topology
-   Multiple ways to deal with this
    -   Encode physics via edge weights?
    -   Partition geometrically?
-   Tradeoffs are why we need to be *informed* users

### Graph partitioning: Is this it?

So far, considered problems with *static* interactions

-   What about particle simulations?
-   Or what about tree searches?
-   Or what about\...?

Next time: more general *load balancing* issues
