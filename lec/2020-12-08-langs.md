% CS 5220: Mixing languages, libraries, and frameworks
% David Bindel

## Grumpy Old Man Warning!

- Lots of opinions ahead
- I can be wrong!

## I have said...

- Use libraries!  And frameworks!  And tools!
- Use high-level languages (Lua, Python)!
- Lots of cool new tools!  UPC++, SYCL, ...
- Languages evolve, prefer modern C/C++/Fortran/Python
- You just need to tweak the `Makefile.in` files

## Why Johnny Can't Build

- Libraries aren't installed
- How do I call Fortran from C++?
- How do I build with Lua, Python, etc?
- What about accelerators?
- How do I link everything?

## Today

- Tool pragmatics
- Languages: big and little
- Some major frameworks

## What is a compiler?

## C/Fortran build flow

- *Compiler* maps source to assembly
  - Or to something else
- *Assembler* maps to object files
- *Librarian* produces
  - Static *archives (`.a`)
  - Dynamic libraries (`.dylib`) / shared objects (`.so`)
- *Linker* combines objects, resolves symbols
- *Loader* brings executables into memory

## Compilation issues

- Language issues
  - Old compiler? (common, alas)
  - Specific extensions?
- Missing header files?

## Assembler issues?

AARGH! (but not so common)

## Static linker issues?

- Problems with name mangling
  - Know: `extern "C"` and `iso_c_binding`
- Can't find libraries?
  - Esp language support libraries

## Dynamic linking issues?

- Dynamic libraries resolve at load time
  - Need to have them on search paths!
- Classic problem: "DLL hell"
  - Versioning on libraries helps
  - Still can run into issues

## Building

- Lowest: compile/link
- Next: Makefiles
- Next: CMake/autoconf/etc
- Use package managers if possible!

## Autoconf

- `configure; make; make install`
- Behind the scenes: shell scripts and M4
- Finds libraries / platform specifics
- Generates build system for you

## CMake

- Commercial tool (Kitware)
  - Pay for documentation
- Configure and build all in one
- Improvement on autotools?

## Package managers

- Common on single node
  - Linux: apt, yum
  - MacOS: brew, macports
  - Cross: conda
- Spack, EasyBuild
  - Support environment modules
  - Allow multiple build toolchains

## A step back

## The mountain of abstraction

Consider class trajectory:

- Started very low-level
- Up to general ideas/kernels
- Up to parallel concepts, applications
- Nirvana: performance "just happens"?

## Low-level frameworks and languages

- OpenMP and MPI
- Intel TBB
- Global arays
- Newer(?) parallel languages, extensions

## Libraries

One thing (or a few) done fast:

- BLAS (MKL, OpenBLAS, ATLAS, etc)
- LAPACK and successors
- FFTW
- Sparse direct solvers

Key challenge: linking (esp across languages)

## Framework libraries

- Many in PDE land
  - PETSc, SLEPc, TAO, etc
  - Trilinos
  - Overture
  - deal.ii
- More complicated interfaces
- Effectively defines embedded solver lang

## Framework libraries

Renaissance thanks to ML!

- TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc
- Often define embedded DSLs
  - Build expression in Python, etc
  - Separate compile/optimize/execute

## Scripting languages and PSEs

- MATLAB, Octave, R, Python, Julia
- "High productivity" vs "high performance"?
- Not necessarily slow!  Extensions, libs, JIT
- Performance strategies transfer
- Bottlenecks may not be where you expect

## Domain specific languages

Great opportunities from limited scope!

- Classic example: SQL
- PDE domain: finite element compilers
  - Dolfin framework
  - Sundance
- Embedded languages/specializers
- Modern: SimIt, GraphIt, Halide, etc

## Simulation codes

- Typical pattern
  - Cusom lang/preproc for problem input
  - Scripting language to describe analysis
  - User-defined elements/modules in compiled lang
- Great for some classes of problems
- Can be torturned into covering other types!

## Role of scripting languages

- Often interpreted
- Great for "high-level"
- Python is the default (or Lua?)
- Interface with C/Fortran for perf

## Issues in mixing languages

- How do languages communicate?
- How are extensions compiled/linked?
- What support libraries are needed?
- Who owns main loop?
- Who owns program objects?
- How are exceptions handled?

## Cross-language calls?

- Via pipes (pre-/post-processors)
- Inter-process communication
- Remote procedure call
- Linked together (with wrapper gen?)

## Mixed language: tech issues

Primary pain points:

- Cross-language communication
- Building and deployment
- Debugging and run-time issues

## Mixed language: social issues

- Availability of docs
- Availability of tools/libraries
- Active user base
- Open-ness of code base?
- Longevity

## Best advice

- Conservative re general-purpose lang
  - (Modern) C++ and Fortran
  - Otherwise, look for C-compatible calling
  - Python on top
- More adventurous for DSLs

Also like Julia (yes, I'm inconsistent)

## Concluding thought

> I don't know what the programming languge of the year 2000 will
> look like, but I know it will be called FORTRAN.
>  -- C.A.R. Hoare
