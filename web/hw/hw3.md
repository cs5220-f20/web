Due 2020-11-17.

Please submit a file with

- a list of team members for the final project (1-3, ideally)
- a short description of the planned work

If you have no ideas, you may wish to look at the recording from 11/5
-- several students who were there said something about what they are
working on.  You might also be interested in using Piazza or Slack
to share ideas.
