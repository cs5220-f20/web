Due 2020-09-22.

1.  Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account for yourself if you
    do not already have one.
2.  Fork the [demos repository](https://github.com/cs5220-f20/demos)
    from the class Github under your account.  Your fork should be
    private.
3.  Give me read permissions to that repository (my Github ID is `dbindel`).
4.  Run the centroid example (on your local machine or on Google Cloud
    Shell).  Save the results to a file `baserun.txt` in the same
    directory, and add that file to your local copy.
5.  Commit the new file and push to your repository on Github.
6.  Submit the URL for your Github repository via CMS.
