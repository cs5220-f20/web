Due 2020-10-20.

0. If possible, try to use this week to catch up with the lecture
   slides. And ask questions!
1. Create an [XSEDE account](https://portal.xsede.org/).  You will
   probably want to make sure that you have [set up Duo for
   multifactor authentication](https://portal.xsede.org/mfa).  Make
   sure you remember your name and password!  You will need to submit
   your username in order for me to add you to the class XSEDE
   allocation (so that you can use
   [Comet](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html#running)
   at SDSC).
2. Complete the `telephone.c` file from the demos directory and run the
   telephone code on Graphite.  You should submit both your
   `telephone.c` file and your output file.
3. Reach out to your class buddies.  Is there anything that I should
   know about how the class is going for them?  Is there anything I
   should know about how the class is going for you?

Submit the completed [hw2.txt](hw2.txt) and your completed `telephone.c` file
and output from running the telephone code on Graphite.
