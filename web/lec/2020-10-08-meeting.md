## Advancing subdomains in a 1D wave simulation

Walk through a [tuned 1D wave code](https://github.com/cs5220-f20/demos/blob/master/wave/c_batch/wave_demo.c)
for running the time stepper (`getopt`-based argument parsing added
after the meeting).

## Breakout groups

1.  Look at the "telephone" example in the demos subdirectory.  Add
    the requested MPI calls to actually pass the messages.  Change the
    `job.pbs` script (PBS) to an appropriate job submission script for
    the Graphite cluster, and test the code there.
2.  Take the batched version of the wave stepper code and think through
    how you might implement an MPI version.  What is the effective flop
    rate for this on Graphite on a million points?  Given what you know 
    from the MPI ping-pong tests, can you come up with a crude estimate 
    of the speedup?
