## Warm-up with Menti (5 minutes)

Question of the day on
[Menti](https://www.mentimeter.com/):

- Most confusing point in the class so far?

## Logistics (5 minutes)

- Add/drop ending
- Class buddies
- Project 1 plans
- Alternate times (TR 1:25-2:40)

## Walk-through: playing with profilers (20 minutes)

## Breakout groups (25 minutes)

1. What is the size of the following C struct, and why?

       typedef struct foo_t {
           char a;
           double b;
       };
  
2. Consider an explicit time stepper on a 256^2 mesh (65536
   points).  Each time step takes time proportional to the mesh size
   (a few flops per mesh point), and every 100 steps we spend 5ms to
   write to disk.  Roughly what fraction of the time is spent on disk
   writes, assumeing that we are going at about the peak flop rate?

3. How fast can you make the centroid code, in principle?
