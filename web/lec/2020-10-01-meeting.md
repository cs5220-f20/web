## Logistics (5 minutes)

- Please use `n2-highcpu-2` for timing and tuning on matmul
- Accounts set up soon on Graphite
  ([CPU](https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/researchit/graphitegpu/graphitecpu/)
  and [GPU](https://it.coecis.cornell.edu/researchit/graphitegpu/)
  - Priority partitions: `cs5220` and `cs5220-gpu`

## Quick discussion of matrix multiply status (10 minutes)

## Examples: [1D waves in C and Python](https://github.com/cs5220-f20/demos/tree/master/wave) (10 minutes)

## Breakout (35 minutes)

1.  Suppose you have a tuned single-core dot product that is limited
    by memory bandwidth (with memory at 12.4 GB/s for one core),
    and sending a message between processors takes 10 microseconds.
    If a parallel dot product implementation requires p-1 messages,
    what is the speedup curve for running a dot product on double
    precision vectors of dimension one million?
2.  Consider a spatial decomposition of "Game of Life" on an n-by-n
    grid with periodic boundary conditions in distributed memory.
    Assume we have a p-by-q grid of processors, and exchange a "halo"
    of d layers of boundary cells every d steps of the simulation.
    How would we model the communication and computation costs at
    each step?  Under what circumstances is it possible to "hide"
    the communication under the computation.  Use a simple model of
    the type discussed toward the end of the particle lecture.
3.  Address the questions at the end of the waves demo.

## Report out (15 minutes)
