## Warm-up with Menti (10 minutes)

Several people arrived a few minutes late, whether because of the hour
or because of not figuring out the Zoom link.  While we waited for
people to join, we asked a questions with
[Menti](https://www.mentimeter.com/):

- What pets do you have?

Thanks to those who showed up from awkward time zones!  I hope it was
worth it.

## Logistics (10 minutes)

We pointed out

- The narrated slides
- HW 0
- Piazza
- Gather.town for office hours and meetups
- CS partner-finding event
- Missing semester, SWC, and Unix resources

## Breakout

1.  Name and favorite cartoon character
2.  Look up system X on Top 500 list.  Can you explain the theoretical
    peak flop rate?
3.  Google to find the Gordon Bell prize for 2020-X where X is
    your group number.  Try to find an article that gives the science
    and some performance numbers.
4.  Discuss point X in Bailey's article (where X is your group number)
5.  Toy analysis from 9/3 notes.
6.  Effective flop rate of matmul on my system?
7.  Repeat experiment with Python, MATLAB, or Julia on your system.
    This will require figuring out how to do timings.
    What is the effective flop rate?
