## Breakout (20 minutes)

Suppose you have a tuned single-core dot product that is limited
by memory bandwidth (with memory at 12.4 GB/s for one core),
and sending a message between processors takes 10 microseconds.
If a parallel dot product implementation requires p-1 messages,
what is the speedup curve for running a dot product on double
precision vectors of dimension one million?

## Report out (10 minutes)
