## Logistics

- [Proj 2](../hw/proj2.html) due today
  - Will accept something a little late
- Skipping project 3
- [HW 3](../hw/hw3.html): final proposal (due next Tues)

## Final projects

- Goal: Understand/improve performance on code of interest
  - Could be single-core tuning
  - Could be parallelization
  - Could be an algorithm investigation
  - Or more! Just ask!
- Great if it is applicable to your research
  - Also fine if it is completely different
- Main outcome is a report
  - Great if it is at a conference paper level
  - But this is not necessary for success
- Teams of 1-3, your choosing
- Idea: advertise your project idea on Piazza
- If you want ideas, ask me
- Can also look at [SuperComputing 20](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/)
