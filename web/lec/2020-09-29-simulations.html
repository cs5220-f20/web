    Welcome again to the audio track version of CS 5220.  This week
    you get five decks - but some of them are short.  We're shifting
    gears a bit, taking the ideas of parallelism and locality
    that we now know are critical to high-performance code and
    connecting them with concepts of locality from physics and
    numerics.  This will probably be refreshing to some of you and
    disconcerting to others.  Don't worry, we'll repeat ourselves;
    there is enough time in the semester to get this, even if it
    doesn't sink in the first time.

  <h3>Parallelism and locality</h3>

  <p>Real world exhibits <em>parallelism</em> and <em>locality</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Particles, people, etc function independently</li>
    <li>Near-field interactions stronger than far-field</li>
    <li>Can often simplify dependence on distant objects</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    The basic premise this week is that we can organize our simulation
    algorithms for high performance by recognizing that they, like the
    physical world, exhibit parallelism and locality.  That is: our
    models often involve things that are independent except through a
    few careful modes of interaction.  That's not just physical
    objects like air hockey pucks or elementary particles, but also
    people, vehicles, etc.  There's a natural decomposition to lots of
    the world.  Moreover, when we think about how things in the world
    interact, we find that the short-range interactions are often a
    lot stronger and more complicated than far-range interactions.
    Even when there is significant interaction at a long range, it's
    often simplified.  If we're modeling the motion of the earth
    through space, we might need to keep track of gravitational
    interactions with all the other planets in our solar system.  But
    to the extent that we need to keep track of nearby solar systems
    at all, we can probably just treat them as single point masses in
    space.  Distance blurs things uout.

  <h3>Parallelism and locality</h3>

  <p>Can get more parallelism / locality through model</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Limited dependency between adjacent time steps</li>
    <li>Can neglect or approximate far-field effects</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    The parallelism and locality in the physical world enters into our
    models in interesting ways.  For example, in the physical world,
    waves of sound travel at fast but finite speeds; hence, when we
    simulate the dynamics of sound waves, we see that there is a
    "speed of sound" effect that limits how far information can travel
    in our computation within a single time step.  In other models,
    like simulations of gravitational attraction, we might make each
    object interact with everything at every time step, but the
    interactions with things far away are weaker and simpler with
    things that are close.

  <h3>Parallelism and locality</h3>

  <p>Often get parallelism at multiple levels</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hierarchical circuit simulation</li>
    <li>Interacting models for climate</li>
    <li>Parallelizing individual experiments in MC or optimization</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    It's also true that we tend to build models that organize the
    world into hierarchical building blocks, and that hierarchy often
    mimics meaningful differences in how components interact with each
    other.  Certainly this is true for engineered system: we can
    separate the simulation of a circuit into coupled simulations of
    the basic building blocks because that is how we design the thing!
    We can also sometimes think of different components of a natural
    system that operate at different time scales.  And then there are
    a variety of numerical methods that involve running lots of
    independent simulations, and one can consider parallelizing across
    simulations and trying to find parallelism within the simulations.

  <h3>Basic styles of simulation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="2020-09-29-discrete.html">Discrete event systems (continuous or discrete time)</a></li>
    <li><a href="2020-09-29-particle.html">Particle systems</a></li>
    <li><a href="2020-10-01-ode.html">Lumped parameter models (ODEs)</a></li>
    <li><a href="2020-10-01-pde.html">Distributed parameter models (PDEs / integral equations)</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Often more than one type of simulation appropriate.<br />
    Sometimes more than one at a time!</p>

    <p>
      The rest of the lecture-lets this week dig into four classes of
      simulations in a little more detail, with an eye to different ways
      of thinking about locality and parallelism in each.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll start
      with discrete event systems, with Conway's "Game of Life" as a
      convenient example.  Then we'll talk about particle systems, where
      "particles" is a
      general term that refers not only to discrete particles in
      physics, but also to discrete entities like people in a simulation
      of a crowd.  It also can refer to "chunks" of matter in a
      simulation of something that we usually consider as a continuum -
      we'll see such a method, sometimes called smoothed particle
      hydrodynamics, in the next project.  Then we'll talk about lumped
      parameter systems and distributed parameter systems - or, if you
      prefer, ODE and PDE models.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a lot here.  I hope you'll find it as entertaining as I
      do!
