    Welcome to CS 5220, Applications of Parallel Computers, the Fall
    2020 deluxe edition.  I am your host, David Bindel.

    This slide deck covers some of the logistical aspects of the
    course.  It is a strange semester, so the logistics are complex.
    I have taught at Cornell for the past decade, but I have not had a
    semester like this before, either.  Also, this is a one-man band;
    I have no course staff this semester.  So, please: bear with me!

    If you want to start with an overview and introduction to the
    technical part of the course, feel free to back out and look at
    that slide deck instead.  It should be hyperlinked from the same
    course schedule page that brought you here.  But the logistics are
    important, too, so I urge you to go through this deck carefully
    and ask questions, either on Piazza or in the course meeting.

  <h2>Slide logistics</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Slides produced
      with <a href="https://revealjs.com/">reveal.js</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Narration via the
      <a href="https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/audio-slideshow">audio-slideshow</a>
      plugin
    </li>
    <li>
      Press the S key to open speaker notes for a text version of the
      narration.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <aside class="notes">
    These slides are produced with the reveal.js framework, and
    narrated with the audio slideshow plugin.  If you want to listen
    to the narration, I recommend doing so at a normal computer rather
    than a mobile device.  I also recommend Chrome, Firefox, or
    Microsoft Edge rather than Safari, as I've had trouble with the
    audio feature on Safari.

    Some of you may have trouble hearing the narration, either because
    of poor hearing, or because of background noise, or because you
    are dead-set on using Safari.  Or, perhaps, you
    read faster than you listen.  In any of these cases, I have added
    speaker notes to the slides, and I intend to follow them closely
    in my narration.

  <h2>Enrollment</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Initial enrollment was restricted to non-CIS majors</li>
    <li>Plenty of room for the waitlist</li>
    <li>Plenty of room generally, and open add/drop</li>
    <li>Please do not register for a formal audit</li>
  </ul>
  
  <aside class="notes">
    For several years, we have restricted enrollment in upper-division
    CS classes.  This is to make sure that our students, particularly
    the MEng students (who register late and who are only hear for one
    year), can take the classes they need.  But parallel scientific
    computing is not ML, and we are not in danger of running out of
    room.  If you were on the waitlist, you should be automatically
    enrolled in the next couple days.  And if you want to add the
    class now, the add/drop period is not restricted.  You can enroll
    through September 16, though sooner is better.
    
    In some semesters, I allow students to formally audit 5220.  This
    semester, if you want to just follow along, I recommend keeping up
    with the material on the web page.  Otherwise, I expect you to
    participate in the homework, the group projects, and other course
    activities.

  <h2>Course community</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A class is not just the lectures and HW!</li>
    <li>We want group <b>interaction</b></li>
    <li>This can be synchronous or asynchronous</li>
    <li>Several things planned, will adapt as we go</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    A class is never just about lectures and homework.  Particularly
    in a class like 5220, you should learn as much from your peers as
    you learn from me.  Managing that peer-to-peer learning is going
    to be a special challenge this semester, but I have some plans for
    how we can foster it, whether through synchronous meetings or
    asynchronous online platforms.  I have a lot of ideas about this,
    and will spend a few moments now telling you about them.  I am as
    new at this as you are, so I will take any good ideas you might
    have, and we can also always throw out things that are not
    working!
  </aside>

<section>
  <h2>Course community</h2>

  <p>
    The typical mix of 5220 students includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>CS undergrad and MEng students (and a few PhD)</li>
    <li>PhD students from other disciplines</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This means we assume you will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Know a C family languages.</li>
    <li>Not know <b>some</b> background.</li>
    <li>Be a teacher and a learner.</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    Let's start with who you are.  Usually, the two main audiences for
    the class are CS undergraduates and MEng students, and PhD
    students from other disciplines who need to do parallel computing
    for their research.  There are also always a few CS PhD students,
    non-traditional students, or undergraduates from other
    disciplines.

    I assume you know how to program in some C family language, and I
    assume you know enough to learn how to navigate in a Unix
    environment without too much lecturing from me -- though I will
    provide some references for those of you who haven't done this
    much.  But otherwise I try not to assume much about what you
    already know.

    What this means is that I expect some of you to be
    confused when I talk about computer architecture, and some of you
    to be confused when I talk about fluid dynamics, and some of you
    to be confused when I talk about numerical methods.  And I may say
    some things that confuse everyone!

    Fortunately, you also have a lot of collective knowledge, and
    students in this class have worked together to do some pretty
    remarkable things.  There are at least two PhD theses in the past
    few years that I know arose largely from projects in this class!
    So plan to learn from each other and teach each other as much as
    you learn from me (and teach me).  And be prepared to ask lots of
    questions.

  <h2>Course meeting</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Main meeting: TR 8:00-9:30</li>
    <li>I will help coordinate alternate meetings, too</li>
    <li>This is not about lecture (class is <q>flipped</q>)</li>
    <li>Goal is discussion and small group activities</li>
    <li>We may also do some programming together!</li>
    <li>Zoom recordings posted to Canvas</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    The main meeting for the class is Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:00
    AM, Eastern.  This is a very awkward time for students who are
    coming in from California, or even for Ithaca students who happen
    to be night owls.  So we will coordinate alternate meeting times,
    too, though these may involve only students and not me.

    I call this a meeting rather than a lecture because I will not be
    going through the narrated lecture slides with you, for the most
    part.  Instead, we will use the time for question-and-answer,
    discussion, and small group activities.  We may also walk through
    code or tool demos together, partly so that you can ask questions
    as we go.  The Zoom recordings of these meetings will be posted to
    Canvas, though any activity that happens in breakout rooms will
    not be recorded.

  <h2>Course buddies</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Role: Make sure nobody falls through cracks</li>
    <li>One or two buddies per student</li>
    <li>You can nominate, if you know people</li>
    <li>I may also do some buddy assignments</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    Once we have a reasonable idea of who is taking the course, I will
    be making a list of "course buddies."  A buddy is just there to
    check in and make sure that things are going OK.  There will be
    reminders to check in with your buddies periodically through the
    semester.

    If you already know a couple people in the semester who you want
    to buddy with, I can take that into account.  But it is also fine
    if you don't know anybody!  I can help with buddy assignments.

<section>
  <h2>Project groups</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Most course work is done in small groups</li>
    <li>We will assign groups for initial projects</li>
    <li>Final project is at your discretion</li>
    <li>Active collaboration and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a> are encouraged!</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    Most of the work in this class is done in small groups, usually
    mixing people from different backgrounds.  These are not the same
    as your class buddies.  I will assign groups for the projects that
    are done in common, but you will have some choice about the final
    project group, just as you have a choice about the final project
    topic.

    I'd prefer that groups don't try to just split projects into a
    bunch of small pieces that can be put together at the end.  The
    goal is to get you to work together.  Online can actually be a
    good environment to practice collaboration techniques like pair
    programming, for example.

<section>
  <h2>Collaboration and AI</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>5220 is <b>supposed</b> to be collaborative!</li>
    <li>Want you to use online resources effectively</li>
    <li>But for academic integrity: <b>cite</b>!</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    This is supposed to be a collaborative class.  There are no exams,
    and the only homeworks are there to make sure that you know the
    basics.  There are also lots of resources online, and I want you
    to understand how things work well enough to be able to look
    things up, judge the answers you find online, and incorporate any
    good ideas into your own work.  There is not a lot of room for
    cheating in all of this, but you definitely should cite any
    resources that you use -- whether in the form of help from a
    friend or from StackOverflow.

<section>
  <h2>Information systems</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5220/2020fa/">Course home page</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.github.com/dbindel/cs5220-f20/">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/18630">Canvas</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://cms.csuglab.cornell.edu/">CMS</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a></li>
    <li>Other
      (<a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>,
       <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>,
       <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>, ...)?</li>
    <li>Computing systems</li>
  </ul>

  <aside class="notes">
    Finally, let's talk about the class information systems.  All of
    the systems we use will be linked from the course home page,
    though those that are restricted may be listed in the Cornell-only
    section.  The non-restricted part of the home page is all built
    from a public Github repository, and you should feel free to file
    issues or pull requests (or just send email) if I make mistakes!

    There is a Canvas page for the class, but I mostly plan
    to use it for sharing Zoom recordings -- we have to restrict
    access to these because of FERPA.  I will use our home-grown
    course management system (CMS) for homework submission and keeping
    track of grades.  We will use Piazza for asynchronous course
    question-and-answer things, but I am also looking at a few options
    to support ad hoc synchronous interactions, including Discord, Slack, and
    Gather.town.  I also encourage you to explore for yourself; for
    example, I know that VisualStudio has support for pair
    programming, though I haven't tried it out myself.  If you come
    across tools that you find useful, let us all know!

    Finally, we will be using various external computing resources
    over the course of the class, and I'll distribute information on
    those when possible.

  <h2>Homework Zero</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Your netid</li>
    <li>How you like to be called</li>
    <li>Your background (degree program, major, etc)</li>
    <li>Whether you can make the main meeting time</li>
    <li>What times might work for you for synchronous meetings (with
      the class or project groups)</li>
    <li>Any proposed "course buddies"</li>
    <li>What you hope to get out of the course</li>
    <li>Any concerns you have at this point</li>
  </ol>

  <aside class="notes">
    In order to manage group interactions, I need to know who you all
    are and where you are coming from, both in terms of your
    background and your time zone.  For this, I will put up a Homework
    0, which you should try to submit via CMS by next Thursday, September 10.
    Let me know who you are, where you're coming from, who you might
    like to buddy with (if you know), and what your hopes and fears
    for the course are.

  <h2>Good luck!</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    Thanks for making it through this first slide deck!  I know that
    it's an odd semester, but I hope we can use it to do something
    interesting.  Get in touch if you have any questions or concerns,
    and remember to submit homework 0!
