## Warm-up with Menti (5 minutes)

Question of the day on
[Menti](https://www.mentimeter.com/):

- What's on your bucket list?

## Logistics (5 minutes)

We pointed out

- The Slack group
- Gather.town office hours
- Resource links (missing semester, SWC, and Unix resources)

Also, some brief suggestions for breakouts: share a common doc,
feel free to pop out and ask me questions (or use Slack).

## From last time (15 min)

Groups 6-10 from last time (whoever was in the lead).

## Breakout (40 minutes)

1.  Name and your one wished-for superpower
2.  Suppose we have n tasks in a p-stage pipeline (and n > p),
    where each pipeline stage takes one clock cycle to complete.
    Including time to drain and fill the pipeline, what is the
    overall number of cycles required?  What fraction of the
    pipeline cycles are empty?
3.  Suppose you had a 16-entry cache that was four-way set associative,
    and that the eviction policy (how you kick something out of the cache)
    is least recently used (LRU).  For the following sequence of reads,
    label whether each would be a cache hit or miss, and the type of
    miss involved (compulsory, capacity, or conflict):
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
    20, 24, 28, 32, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32
4.  Consider the teaser from the 9/10 lecture slides (computing
    the centroid of a million points in the plane).  Which do you
    think would be fastest, and why?  If you have time, consider
    writing a short C program to test your hypothesis.

## Discussion (10 minutes)
