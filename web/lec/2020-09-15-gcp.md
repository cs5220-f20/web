title: Getting familiar with GCP

The [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) is one of the
three major cloud platforms (the others are Amazon Web Services and
Microsoft Azure).  Thanks to their generous
[https://edu.google.com/programs/?modal_active=none](program for
higher education), we have some credits to use as part of our
computing resources this semester.  In this document, we are going to
walk through some of the basics of working with GCP.

## Concepts

Let's start with a little GCP vocabulary:

- *user*: This is you, as identified by your Google account.
- *billing account*: This is a source of funds for using Google cloud
  platform resources.  In particular, you will set up a billing
  account associated with your course credit courtesy of the Google
  education program.
- *project*: A project is where we actually keep track of resources in
  GCP.  A project is associated with a billing account that is used to
  pay for any resources.
- [*Compute Engine*](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs): The name
  of Google's "infrastructure as a service" offering.  Lets us create
  virtual machines where we can develop and run our codes.
- [*Cloud Shell*](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/): A free GCP
  service that gives us a (short-lived) virtual machine and 5 GB of
  persistent storage.  Recommended for lightweight development tasks.

## Starting at the console

The starting point for our exploration is the [Cloud
Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  From the console, you
can select a current project or create a new project.  You will need a
project in order to be able to use any of the compute engine
resources.

In the top menu of the screen, just to the right of the search bar, is
the icon for the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/).
If you click on that, Google will start a session for you on a small,
short-lived virtual machine  (an `e2-small` instance in Google
terminology) with 5 GB of persistent storage for a home
directory.  Alternately, you can access the cloud shell with the
[gcloud command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud), which
you can install on your local machine.  If you're iffy on how to get
around in Unix, I recommend the [software
carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons.html) lessons and the
[MIT missing semester course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu).  There
is also a [good Linux introduction from
CAC](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/Linux).

The Cloud Shell machine is a full-blown Debian install, with a variety
of development tools.  For messing around and "hello world" types of
programs, I highly recommend using this as a starting development
environment.  If you want to build anything big, or do some timing
runs, you should use Compute Engine to get a Linux VM set up.

## Setting up git

You will probably want to set up your cloud shell instance to use git
(at least, that's what I wanted on my system) for cross-machine
version control.  I recommend you start the process by telling the
system who you are.  From the cloud shell, type

    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

where the email and name are replaced with your actual email and name.

You may also want to set up password-less access to your 
[Github](https://github.com/) account, assuming you use Github.
I highly recommend getting familiar with at least the basics of git
and Github, though if you find that you're just muddling through and
figuring it out as you go, you are in great company.  If you use the
Google SDK, you can [forward your authentication credentials from your
home
machine](https://medium.com/@davidstanke/til-forward-ssh-agent-for-easy-github-authentication-f67c83e2d286);
alternately, you can set up a new SSH key on your cloud shell
instance:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s")
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

then copy the SSH public key that you printed in the last step to
the [Github authentication settings
page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
Once this is set up, you can push and pull to your private
repositories at will.  You can add this to your bash profile to make
sure that the SSH agent is set up whenever you start the cloud shell

    if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] ; then
      eval `ssh-agent -s`
      ssh-add
    fi

you can edit `.bash_profile` with a standard Unix editor like vi, or
using the "Open Editor" button at the top of the cloud shell window.

## Walk through Linux VM quickstart

Once you have things set up to your liking with the cloud shell, I
recommend trying out the [Linux VM quickstart
guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux).  This
will show you how to create a new Debian Linux VM with a single CPU.
This type of virtual machine is quite inexpensive to run, and we will
be using it for some of our single-core timing and tuning homework
exercises.  Make sure to shut the machine down when you are done with it!
